# News Reader Mini App
### Yahoo News Reader Mini App test

Your job is to implement a simple news reader app. The app will have two screens: a News Stream and Article Detail.

Requirements in order of priority from most important to least:

- **News Stream**: List of news articles, each with a thumbnail image, provider, and title
- **News Stream**: List should be sorted by publish date
- **News Stream**: Each news article cell should be sized appropriate to the content (potentially different sized cells).
- **News Stream**: When scrolling down the news feed, when the bottom is reached a next set of news items should be fetched & displayed (using the pagination field)
- **News Stream**: When tapping on a news article cell in the News Stream, it should open to the Article Detail screen showing the contents of the article.
- **Article Detail**: Display the contents of the selected article, including images. The article style and layout is up to you, but it should be comfortably readable.
- **News Stream**: Pull-to-refresh should refresh existing articles with changes, and bring in any new articles.

Bonus:

- Support offline reading

The exercise is designed to be open ended, feel free to add enhancements (animations, styling, etc.), as long as it is in keeping with the requirements. Please keep track of the approximate time spent on the exercise (it usually takes between 3-6 hours), and return your code to us within 24 hours.

Language used should be Swift, and you can use UIKit or SwiftUI. You are welcome to use 3rd party libraries/SDKs/Cocoapods/SPM, but be prepared to discuss why you chose them and how they work in the context of your app.
